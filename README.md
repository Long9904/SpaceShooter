Link Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8K03ntpK4

A 2D space game where you pilot a spaceship, dodge obstacles, collect items, and shoot enemies.  
Goal: survive as long as possible while managing **Gas (fuel)**, **Energy**, and **Health**.

## How to Play
- **Move:** W A S D or Arrow Keys  
- **Shoot:** Left Mouse Button  
- **Boost Speed:** Hold Space  
- **Stop Boost:** Release Space  

## Gameplay
- **Boost** makes everything move faster but drains Energy.  
  - Boost automatically stops if Energy < 10 or when you release Space.  
- **Gas** decreases over time. If it reaches 0, you lose.  
- Collect **Gas** to refill fuel and **Shield** to activate a 5-second shield.  
- **Health** drops when hitting obstacles, enemy bullets, or enemies.  
  - Health = 0 â†’ your ship explodes.

## Tips
- Use Boost wisely to dodge obstacles or outpace enemies.  
- Prioritize collecting Gas to avoid running out of fuel.  
- Stay away from screen edges for more reaction time.
